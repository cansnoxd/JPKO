# My JPKO 1298 Database Project

Thanks to Twostars for Original Database

I dont see any reason to make this project script based
(Using database format benefits faster load time and restore database time on SQL Server)

Needs 7zip or Winrar
(I had to compressed it due to database file size)

Needs SQL Server 2012
